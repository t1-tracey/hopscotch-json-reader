# hopscotch-json-reader

This is an unofficial thing made by a user/fan of the [Hopscotch app](http://www.gethopscotch.com) :P

Currently just reads JSON from a project URL and then saves it in a file :)

Please feel very free to ask about anything here on the [Hopscotch forum](http://forum.gethopscotch.com/t/hopscotch-project-json-reader/32867?u=t1_hopscotch)!
